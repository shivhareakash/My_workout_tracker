Every body part is ideally supposed to be entered as 'Topic' and each topic will have 3 linked sub branches - Goals, Progress, Mistakes. As an example

Topic= 'Biceps'
Subtopic> Goal {This will track the goal of the user for this muscle group (Biceps)}
Subtopic> Mistake {This will track the mistakes of the user for this muscle group (Biceps)}
Subtopic> Progress {This will track the progress of the user for this muscle group (Biceps)}
